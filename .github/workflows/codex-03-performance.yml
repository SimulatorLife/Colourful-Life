        Profile and analyze the codebase to identify performance bottlenecks. Select one
        high-impact area (such as a module, file, or method) that, if optimized, will
        materially improve speed or scalability. Refactor that area by eliminating
        unnecessary computations, reducing memory overhead, or consolidating redundant
        database/API calls. Where appropriate, cache repeated work, simplify data
        structures, or replace heavy operations with lighter alternatives. Ensure the
        optimization preserves readability and maintainability, and validate the changes
        with profiling or benchmarks to confirm measurable gains without regressions.
