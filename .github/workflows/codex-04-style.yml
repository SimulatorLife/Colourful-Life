      prompt: >
        Review the codebase and focus on one area where coding style and standards are inconsistent
        (such as formatting, naming, file structure, or repeated ad-hoc patterns). Normalize that area to match
        project-wide conventions, applying consistent formatting, naming, and organization. Where applicable, align
        error handling, logging, or configuration loading with established patterns. Ensure linter and formatter rules
        are enforced, removing style drift while keeping the code uniform, predictable, and easy for contributors to read.
        Avoid large-scale rewrites; focus on a single, high-impact area that improves overall consistency without
        altering functionality.
