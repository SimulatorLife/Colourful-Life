        Review the codebase and focus on one area where unused or redundant code exists. 
        Identify functions, variables, files, assets, or configuration entries that are no longer referenced. 
        Remove or archive them safely, and consolidate partial duplicates where possible. 
        The goal is to reduce bloat, simplify the repository, and ensure every line of code serves a purpose. 
        Limit the scope to a single, high-impact area in this run rather than attempting to clean the entire codebase at once.
