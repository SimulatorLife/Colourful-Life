      prompt: >
        Review the architecture and select ONE overly coupled area (a module cluster, package, or
        dependency cycle) that, if refactored, will materially improve modularity. Briefly justify
        the choice, then decouple that area by separating concerns, reducing circular dependencies,
        and introducing clearer boundaries (interfaces/facades) only where necessary—avoid
        over-engineering. Update imports/usages accordingly, keep the diff small and behavior-preserving,
        and run formatters/linters/tests to ensure no regressions. The goal for this run is a focused,
        maintainable restructuring that supports future growth while reducing technical debt.
