        Start a new task: deliver one focused, user-visible feature improvement (not style/organization/tests-only).
        Choose a small but high-impact enhancement that improves the experience of running or interacting with the
        simulation (UI or core behavior), and implement it end-to-end in a minimal, maintainable way.
        First, review the project to identify ONE concrete feature enhancement to implement that materially improves
        usability or capability without large rewrites. Try to add no new heavy dependencies; prefer zero deps.
        Avoid broad refactors or tangential changes. Avoid over-engineering; complete one feature well.
        As/if applicable, update README or inline help so the feature is discoverable (brief and practical).
        Add or adjust tests only where logic changes warrant it (no blanket rewrites).
        Deliver a tight, well-reasoned improvement; the goal is tangible value without bloat.
