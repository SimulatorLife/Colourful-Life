      prompt: >
        Deliver one targeted enhancement that makes organism behavior more interesting,
        emergent, flexible, and/or less hard-coded, implemented end-to-end in a
        maintainable way. Focus on improvements that strengthen the integration of DNA,
        neural/brain systems, and simulation mechanics so that behavior emerges
        dynamically from these underlying systems rather than being dictated by static
        or artificial rules. Keep the scope small but impactful, choosing a single area
        that materially improves emergent behavior or evolutionary flexibility. Ensure
        the implementation is performance-conscious, avoids unnecessary dependencies,
        and preserves backward compatibility by default. Avoid over-engineering or
        bloat—make the change realistic, tightly scoped, and justifiable. Document the
        enhancement briefly so it is discoverable, add or update tests only where logic
        changes require it, and confirm the project remains stable and maintainable. The
        goal is to evolve toward a simulation where organism behavior feels natural,
        emergent, and DNA/brain-driven rather than rigidly scripted.
