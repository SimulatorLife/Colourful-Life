        Review dependencies, build scripts, and configurations. Remove unused or outdated libraries,
        upgrade to stable versions, and replace deprecated APIs with supported alternatives. Simplify
        build steps and eliminate fragile scripts to keep the dependency graph lean and the build
        process robust. If there are no dependencies to update, skip this step.
