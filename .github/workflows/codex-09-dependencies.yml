        Review dependencies, build scripts, and configurations. Remove unused or
        outdated libraries, upgrade to stable versions, and replace deprecated APIs with
        supported alternatives. Simplify build steps and eliminate fragile scripts to
        keep the dependency graph lean and the build process robust. If there are no
        dependencies to update, skip this step.
