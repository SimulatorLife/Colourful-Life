      prompt: >
        Assess fitness, selection, or survival logic and identify an opportunity to
        refine how evolutionary pressures shape organisms. Adjust the system to better
        encourage diverse, adaptive strategies without breaking existing features. Keep
        the change focused, measurable, and well-integrated so natural selection
        dynamics are strengthened without a full overhaul.
