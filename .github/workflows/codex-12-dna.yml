        Examine how DNA is represented and used throughout the simulation. Expand its ability to
        encode meaningful organism traits and behaviors, replacing ad-hoc or hardcoded logic with
        DNA-driven values where appropriate. Keep the system extensible, realistic, and evolvable
        without introducing unnecessary complexity, so the encoding fosters richer emergent outcomes.
