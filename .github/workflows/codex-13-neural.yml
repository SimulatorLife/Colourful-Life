      prompt: >
        Review the neural or brain system and find one behavior currently controlled by rigid
        conditions that should instead be neuron-driven. Refactor that case so neural activation
        governs the behavior in a clean, maintainable way. Keep the change scoped but impactful to
        strengthen the role of the neural system in driving flexible, emergent organism behavior.
