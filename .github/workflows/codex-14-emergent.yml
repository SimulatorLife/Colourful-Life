      prompt: >
        Identify a hardcoded, rule-based behavior in the simulation and reframe it into
        an emergent system that arises naturally from organism traits, DNA, or
        environmental interactions. Implement the shift in a focused way that preserves
        readability while reducing rigid control logic, moving the simulation toward
        more realistic, dynamic behavior.
