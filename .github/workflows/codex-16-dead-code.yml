        Scan the repository for unused functions, variables, files, assets, or configuration entries.
        Remove or archive one meaningful set of unused items, consolidating duplicates if needed.
        Keep the change tight and non-disruptive, verifying that no active features depend on what is
        removed so the codebase remains lean and purposeful.
