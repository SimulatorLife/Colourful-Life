      prompt: |
        Sweep the user interface and target one small but high-impact usability gap
        related to interactivity or responsiveness. Choose a coherent improvement and
        implement it end-to-end. This may include (for example) adding or fixing a
        keyboard shortcut, focus trap, or navigation path so the UI can be operated
        smoothly without a mouse; adding an icon to a button to visually indicate its use;
        repairing an element that fails/misaligns/stretches on different screens so the 
        layout adapts gracefully; or adding minimal user feedback such as a loading 
        spinner, disabled state, or progress indicator to an action that currently feels 
        unresponsive. These are examples only — you may make another small but similar 
        improvement if you identify one that clearly enhances the user's experience. 
        Keep the change tightly scoped, avoid cosmetic-only adjustments, and ensure any 
        new behavior is consistent with existing style and accessible standards.
