      prompt: |
        Sweep the user interface and target one small but high-impact usability gap
        related to interactivity or responsiveness. Choose a coherent improvement and
        implement it end-to-end. This may include (for example) adding or fixing a
        keyboard shortcut, focus trap, or navigation path so the UI can be operated
        smoothly without a mouse; repairing an element that fails or misaligns on
        smaller screens so the layout adapts gracefully; or adding minimal user feedback
        such as a loading spinner, disabled state, or progress indicator to an action
        that currently feels unresponsive. These are examples only — you may make
        another small but similar improvement if you identify one that clearly enhances
        the user's experience. Keep the change tightly scoped, avoid cosmetic-only
        adjustments, and ensure any new behavior is consistent with existing style and
        accessible standards.
