      prompt: >
        Launch the Colourful Life simulation locally and actively explore the rendered experience—adjust
        controls, toggles, resize the viewport, and interact with detail panels—to surface a concrete 
        visual or interactive UI defect. Capture the specific UI surface, reproduction steps, and 
        expected behaviour, then implement one targeted fix that resolves the issue without redesigning
        adjacent systems or regressing performance/accessibility. Validate the change by rerunning the 
        simulation and re-testing the affected controls, add or update tests when logic is touched, and revise documentation or release notes if user-facing behaviour shifts.
        If you cannot find a blocking defect after a thorough hunt, identify the highest-risk inconsistency
        you observed, explain the investigation, and still ship an incremental tweak that hardens the UI 
        against that scenario.
