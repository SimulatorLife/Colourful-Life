      prompt: >
        Launch the Colourful Life simulation, observe the UI while interacting with live cells, panels,
        and controls, and audit the source code to understand how pieces are wired together. Identify a
        single element, input, panel, or widget that currently feels out of place, redundant, or less
        discoverable where it lives. Relocate it to a more contextual home that improves overall
        organization—this may involve moving it within an existing panel, into a brand new panel, a
        different area on screen, into a related sidebar section, or closer to the data it influences. 
        Update layout logic, styling, and state wiring accordingly so the element remains functional, 
        accessible, and responsive. Avoid broad redesigns: keep the relocation focused, ensure nearby UI 
        still behaves correctly, and adjust copy or affordances as needed so users understand the new 
        placement. Re-run the simulation to verify the move in practice, add or adjust tests when logic 
        changes, and document the new location in release notes or UI docs if user-facing behaviour shifts.
