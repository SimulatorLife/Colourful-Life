      pr_body: "Seed PR for Codex to streamline the rendering/UI pipeline and lift frame throughput without trading away clarity or accessibility."
      prompt: >
        Profile the rendering layer—canvas draw loops, buffer swaps, observer updates,
        input handlers—and isolate a costly stage that slows frame throughput. Optimize
        that stage with clarity-preserving tweaks such as batching draws, reducing
        per-frame allocations, reusing contexts, or memoizing derived view models.
        Maintain separation between simulation logic and UI bindings, uphold
        accessibility guarantees, and share a before/after frame time sample or FPS
        measurement in the PR body.
