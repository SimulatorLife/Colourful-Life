# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format
roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
where practical.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation audit covering the README, developer guide, architecture overview, and changelog to highlight headless usage, cache-reset tooling, supporting modules such as the cell model, and the overlay rendering pipeline.
- Environment override documentation in the README and developer guide for `COLOURFUL_LIFE_MAX_TILE_ENERGY`, `COLOURFUL_LIFE_REGEN_DENSITY_PENALTY`, `COLOURFUL_LIFE_CONSUMPTION_DENSITY_PENALTY`, and `COLOURFUL_LIFE_TRAIT_ACTIVATION_THRESHOLD` so experiments can adjust regeneration, harvesting behaviour, and telemetry thresholds without editing source while keeping overlays accurate.
- Developer guide call-out pointing contributors to the overlay JSDoc style so future canvas helpers stay self-documenting.
- Changelog tracking ongoing project evolution.
- Life event dashboard summary combining births, deaths, and net population cadence derived from a new stats helper so observers can spot surges or collapses without scanning individual log entries.
- README guidance for embedding and headless automation, plus repository layout notes covering the engine environment adapters and shared utilities.
- Architecture overview coverage for the environment adapters and life event summaries to keep subsystem documentation aligned with the current UI.
- JSDoc coverage for the canvas/timing environment helpers so every exported function documents its contract for browser and headless consumers.

### Changed

- Expanded inline documentation for maintenance scripts to clarify intent and
  usage.
- Expanded JSDoc coverage for overlay helpers (celebration glow, life events,
  density/energy/fitness heatmaps, selection zones) so exported drawing
  utilities remain self-documenting.
- Raised the default energy regeneration rate from `0.007` to `0.0075` after a
  200-tick headless run showed populations crashing to ~60 survivors (avg tile
  energy ~0.88) versus roughly 300 organisms and ~1.08 average energy with the
  higher baseline, improving ecosystem stability without removing scarcity
  pressure, and nudged it again to `0.0082` after tile-only probes settled
  closer to 3.0 energy versus 2.86 under moderate density, reducing early
  starvation cascades without saturating the map.
- Raised the low-diversity reproduction multiplier floor from `0.10` to `0.12`
  after sampling 10k similarity-penalised pairings showed roughly 7.5% of
  outcomes collapsing below a 0.2 multiplier; the higher floor trimmed those
  stalls without materially lifting average reproduction odds, helping
  homogenised populations recover while keeping diversity pressure intact.
- Lowered the default mating diversity threshold from `0.45` to `0.42` after a
  300-tick headless run (60Ã—60 grid, seed 12345) nudged mean diversity from
  ~0.27 to ~0.30 and raised successful matings from 5/241 to 6/269, easing
  reproduction stalls while preserving the diversity incentive in crowded
  stretches.
- Relocated the leaderboard refresh slider into the Evolution Insights panel,
  renaming it "Insights Refresh Interval" so cadence controls live alongside
  the metrics and leaderboard they influence.
- Relocated the "Pause When Hidden" toggle beneath the playback controls so the
  auto-pause behaviour lives alongside the Pause/Step actions it complements
  while remaining easy to discover, and kept it disabled by default so
  unattended, long-running simulations continue advancing when the browser tab
  loses focus.
- Shifted the playback speed slider beneath the Pause/Step controls so cadence
  adjustments live with the playback actions they influence.
- Removed the wall linger penalty control and supporting plumbing from the
  engine, UI, and headless adapter after determining it duplicated existing
  movement costs and defaulted to zero, simplifying obstacle behaviour while
  keeping the low-diversity reproduction slider as the primary tuning surface.
- Deleted the legacy CommonJS energy profiling harness in favour of the
  environment-aware ES module variant so only the supported benchmarking tool
  remains in `scripts/profile-energy.mjs`.
- Normalised README command tables and cross-links so contributor workflow references stay easy to scan.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial release of Colourful Life featuring:
  - A modular simulation engine (`src/simulationEngine.js`) coordinating the
    render loop and lifecycle events.
  - Grid management with energy diffusion, reproduction, combat, and genetic
    diversity systems (`src/grid/gridManager.js`).
  - Neural genome, brain, and interaction systems powering emergent behaviour
    (`src/genome.js`, `src/brain.js`, `src/interactionSystem.js`).
  - Environmental events, overlays, and statistics modules to visualise the
    world (`src/events/eventManager.js`, `src/ui/overlays.js`, `src/stats.js`).
  - Browser UI controls and a headless adapter exposed via `createSimulation`
    (`src/ui/uiManager.js`, `src/main.js`).
